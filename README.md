### Final project of a tourism app

Final project I made for ISDI coders web development bootcamp. It features a complete CRUD on the ruins, and can add and delete comments, as well as add ruins to visited and favorites. Made with Nodejs and express, using MongoDB and mongoose. Tested with Jest and supertest for full E2E testing.
